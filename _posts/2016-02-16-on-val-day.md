A little piece about how we all deny any interest in Valentine's Day and yet we attach a great amount of importance on it via :  superstitions, dates, unintentded meanings, luck.

## Valentines of significance?

We the undersigned do not care about Valentine's Day. We are complacent to its charms and lay no significance to it in any way.

- Carrie's birthday was on Valentine's Day exactly.  She thought it was curse...

- Amelia's birthday was 2 days after.  She thought it was a curse.

- Arbnesha's birthday was 1 day prior. Shw thought it was a curse.

- Agnesa's wedding day was intentionally booked to be on Valentine's Day.  It was not at all cursed, despite the fridged temperatures, the party was excellent, the food was fresh and everybody was able to attend.
