## Second header (H2)

I am trying some things

### THird Header

[View the markdown used to create this post](#)

#### Header 4

This is a paragraph, it's surrounded by whitespace. Next up are some headers, they're heavily influenced by GitHub's markdown style.





A link to [caleb pacman](http://calebhamilton.com/pacman). OR LITERALLY  <http://gcalebhamilton.com/pacman/>

An image, located within /images

![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/jekyll-logo.png "an image title")

Inline markup styles:

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()`

> She said it was the best day of her life
>> IT WAS THE BEST DAY OF HER LIFE


```CODE:

/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
var i = $(.me)+100;
```

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
