**I been working on increasing my overall knowledge**...

+ so to call myself a _Full-Stack_ **developer**. I do spend a most of my time in templates, styles and HTML.

I enjoy new experiences, this is one of my newer projects.  The Github experience is also new for me. Jekyll is o.k. so far.  

I started using Atom text-editor, and it's integrated with my Github account, making everything super easy since Github is hosting this Jekyll blog.
