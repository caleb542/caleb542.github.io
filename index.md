### Markdown

I don't know why we do this, but markdown is a real thing.  I haven't seen any __real__ bloggers blogging in jekyll, bloggers want a MSWORD type of experience, and as such they like WYSIWYG editors, and we don't seem to have one for Jekyll.  I am typing this on Prose editor, which shows you the Markdown, but isn't foolproof.

Developers who blog seem to like Jekyll, but developers tend to like little challenges like this.

If I were to ship an existing WP blog to Jekyll, I would have to teach the client about markdown, or create a WYSIWYG editor to markdown for said blogger. I am not sure that would be an easy sell...

in any case, I continue to try.

**I been working on increasing my overall knowledge**...

+ so to call myself a _Full-Stack_ **developer**. I do spend a most of my time in templates, styles and HTML.

I enjoy new experiences, this is one of my newer projects.  The Github experience is also new for me. Jekyll is o.k. so far.  

I started using Atom text-editor, and it's integrated with my Github account, making everything super easy since Github is hosting this Jekyll blog.
