## That's *me*.

I been working on increasing my overall knowledge, so I can call myself a Full-Stack developer. I do spend a most of my time in templates, styles and HTML.

I enjoy new experiences, this is one of my newer projects.  The Github experience is also new for me
Jekyll is o.k. so far.  

I started using Atom text-editor, and it's integrated with my Github account, making everything super easy since Github is hosting this Jekyll blog.
